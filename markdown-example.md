# Here's an example in Markdown

This chapter was written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  In your editor, type the following:

<pre data-executable="true" data-code-language="p5js" id="mycode">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 480);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
</pre>

This program creates a window that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse. When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. Weâ€™ll explain more about the elements of this program in detail later. For now, run the code, move the mouse, and click to experience it.
